# Welcome to the Publisher Insights Wikis
This is a community maintained wiki covering all insights involving publishers across the internet. Insights about publisher domains can be about publisher quality guidelines or publisher-specific data. The purpose of these wikis is to empower ADT holders with useful data and credible guidelines as they curate the adChain Registry.

## About the adChain Registry
The adChain Registry is a token-curated registry on the Ethereum blockchain where adToken (ADT) holders curate the registry for high-quality publishers. The curation of the registry creates value for Advertisers who look to target their digital ad campagings to non-fraudulent publishers. The adChain Registry does not directly point to what is fraud and what isn't, but it empowers the ADT holders to draw the line on fraud.

## Contribution Guidelines
Users signed in with GitHub can edit and add pages using the [browser](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-wiki-pages-via-the-online-interface/) or [locally](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-and-editing-wiki-pages-locally/). Do not change the title of a page, as the link for it will change. In particular, if you change the title for this page, the link https://github.com/AdChain/publisher-insights/wiki, as well as the Wiki tab in the header of this repo, will just direct to a list of pages, rather than this page, so don't change the title of this page! If you want to translate a page, create a new page and translate the original there. Consider previewing your changes before saving them, and if you detect any errors, fix them.

Wikipedia has [five pillars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Five_pillars) which provide a good standard for contributing that we can adapt for our needs.
